## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of Java implementations for fundamental data structures. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented examples that can be used for educational purposes or as a reference for implementing these structures in Java projects.

## Implemented Data Structures

- [LinkedList](MyLinkedList/src/com/my/ownLinkedlist/LinkedList.java): Implementation of a singly linked list.
- [Stack](StackImplementataion/src/com/HomeWork/MyStack.java): Implementation of a stack using array.
- [Stack](StackOperation/src/MyLinkedStack/LinkedListStack.java): Implementation of a stack using linkedlist.
- [Queue](MyQueue/src/DoubleEndedQueue/Queue.java): Implementation of a queue.
- [BinarySearchTree](BST/src/bst.java): Implementation of a binary search tree.
- [HashMap](src/main/java/HashMap.java): Implementation of a hash map.

*Feel free to explore the code for additional details on each implementation.*
